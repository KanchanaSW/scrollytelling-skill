# scrollytelling-data

A [Cursor](https://cursor.com) and [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) skill that builds a **data scrollytelling article**: one sticky/pinned chart, steps that scroll past it, numbers that morph — and a chart that is a **pure function of the current step index**.

Same camera philosophy as [scroll-portfolio](https://github.com/KanchanaSW/scroll-portfolio): one scroll authority, one `requestAnimationFrame` family, visual state derived from a single number. Different product: a vertical data story, not a horizontal résumé camera.

Not enter/leave choreography. Not a transition queue. Not `position: sticky` inside a transformed Lenis/GSAP parent.

## Install

From a local checkout of this repo:

```bash
chmod +x scripts/install.sh
./scripts/install.sh
```

That links:

- `~/.cursor/skills/scrollytelling-data` — Cursor
- `~/.claude/skills/scrollytelling-data` — Claude Code

Or clone straight into a skills directory:

```bash
git clone <this-repo> ~/.claude/skills/scrollytelling-data
ln -sfn ~/.claude/skills/scrollytelling-data ~/.cursor/skills/scrollytelling-data
```

```

## The format in one paragraph

The graphic stays on screen (ScrollTrigger pin, not sticky-inside-transform). Steps scroll beside it. Lenis owns scroll; GSAP's ticker is the only RAF; on each tick the owner measures step tops against a trigger line and writes **one** `stepIndex`. The chart renders `states[index]` — a full snapshot, never `addSeries` / `reset`. Fast-scroll to the last step shows the last snapshot, not a queued film of the beats in between. Scrolling up to step N looks like scrolling down to step N.

## After install

Restart Cursor / start a new Claude Code session so the skill description is in the catalog. Ask to scaffold a data scrolly; the agent should read `SKILL.md` then `references/camera.md` before writing scroll or chart code.
